      		            <h2>WhoRunsIt is no more</h2> 

<p>When we started out with WhoRunsIt, our aim was simple: to make the public record more transparent. It surprised us that company director data wasn't more freely available or easily searchable. After all it's the public record: essential for an accountable, open society. So we bought a bulk data package from Companies House and built a simple application, database and API around it. We set out to make what we thought Companies House should be offering. WhoRunsIt was (to our knowledge) the first site to allow free searches on director names, not just company names. It remains to this day the only such site with a freely accessible API with results in machine-readable formats. </p>

<p>Since WhoRunsIt launched, we've seen tremendous growth and innovation in this sector. <a href="http://www.levelbusiness.com/">LevelBusiness</a> and <a href="http://www.duedil.com/">Duedil</a> in particular have led the way in building a business around public data. <a href="http://www.opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> has become an astonishing resource; not just a truly global database of companies, but also an authority on how that data should be presented and shared. Their tireless work helped shape the new Companies House open data site and unique company URLs. </p>

<h2>Why close down?</h2>

<p>Without the means to keep the data fresh, WhoRunsIt becomes less and less relevant. We could only afford (very occasional) snapshots of the public record, but hundreds, even thousands, of companies are created, closed, or change directors every week, many of them lasting just a few days. Snapshots completely fail to capture this information, but a daily feed costs nearly £28,000/year.</p>

<h2>But what if you…?</h2>

<p>We tried taking donations (we got nearly €1!), and others have offered us updated snapshots in the past. Both are very generous, but neither really address the problem. And since we believe that advertising or charging for access would undermine the value and purpose of the site, our options were limited. We think the real solution is for Companies House to either provide this service itself, or make the data freely available. This is finally beginning to happen; Companies House is now including director appointment information in their paid API, and OpenCorporates.com now features some directorship information.</p>

<h2>But I really need this site!</h2>

<p>If none of the alternatives out there will do, <a href="http://inanimatt.com/contact.html">get in touch</a> and we may be able to help you.</p>

<h2>I'll do it instead!</h2>

<p>You're beautiful and crazy and we love you. <a href="http://inanimatt.com/contact.html">Get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/tuimedia/whorunsit">source code</a> to WhoRunsIt is open-source, and hosted on GitHub. You can run your own copy by obtaining the relevant data files from <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/ourPrices.shtml">Companies House</a> (Bulk data products, company appointments full snapshot - now £250) and hosting the service yourself. We managed to run WhoRunsIt quite happily on a <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=728b2f06af916e48ae00ec5752b87b044e91445f">Linode 768</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, the wonderful <a href="http://www.opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> is now incorporating UK company director information into their site. It's even more limited than what we showed, but it's more sustainably-run, mixed with richer corporate data, and global. It may be exactly what you need.</p>
